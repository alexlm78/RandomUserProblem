# RandomUserProblem

This is a simple project with two way to solve a problem from a Go Engineer position.

The premise is to create a simple app to get 15k of user from randomeuser.me API, The trick is that the API only return 5000 users per request.

This is just a simple and quick way to do it, I'm sure there are better ways to do it, but I'm just trying to show a quick way to solve the problem.

Thanks.
